# Codon-Optimality-
Code I wrote while working in Pasquinelli's lab for scoring codons. This is the version I was able to recover.  
CodonMinMaxScores.xls	is an excel that the SearchDictAndPrintOut.py can create.
SearchDictAndPrintOut.py can also search the dictionary and output the genes that meet the search.
EvaluatorDictionary.py	creates a dictionary data structure that stores gene subdictionaries that store geneName codons  codonScores Gene_Name	Alias	Number_of_reads	Normalized_expression	Median	PolyA_class	25%_percentile	75%_percentile	MAX_polyA	MIN_polyA	RANGE_polyA	Mean	Geometric_mean	Standard_deviation	Fop	Codon_class   of given gene.
RealStrands_Edited_for_size.txt	contains the gene sequences scored.
sequenceInfoOriginal.txt stores the information on genes that the lab had poly A tail information on.
